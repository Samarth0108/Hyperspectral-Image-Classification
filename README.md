In summary, this project concentrates on recognizing each pixel of the hyperspectral image and assigning a class label to each example. The main objective is to accurately identify the objects in the images such as water, grass, trees, road, vegetation, soil, buildings, etc. based on their spectral properties and features. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) is used for classification of the hyperspectral images. The accuracy of SAM is compared with other algorithms and came to the conclusion that SAM provides better accuracy in classifying the each pixel of the hyperspectral image. Our research also highlighted the importance of fairness and ethics in using this technology. It is crucial to make sure that the classification and analysing are unbiased and transparent. Even though our work is successful, still there is much to explore and make our model more reliable so that it can classify the pixels of the hyperspectral image with more accuracy and features.
